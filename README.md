# History-Sonic-Adventure

# My name is Camila Rosado and I am a Del Tech student for IT
# I am using GitHub for a Project assignment!

# Added some files and images in my repository, this is all very new and confusing but I made everything in my code all in Visual Studio Code. It breifly goes over Sonic Adventure and its history of making.
