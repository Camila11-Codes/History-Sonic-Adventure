                Sonic Adventure is a video game from the Sonic the Hedgehog series. This game is one that is beloved by majority of the sonic fans!
                This game was developed by the Sonic Team and published by Sega. Sonic Adventure was released on the Dreamcast and marketed as the first Sonic title on a sixth-generation console and the slow transition to 3D gameplay.
                At the time, this game was revolutionary for its transition to 3D, like many other games who transitioned to 3D at the time.
                The first game has 6 main characters who we can switch POVs from and get their version of the main story! We can chose from Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Big the Cat, and Gamma (aka; E-102 series).
                The game's story is based on Chaos, an ancient deity of destruction thanks to negative energy, who Dr.Eggman wants to control in order to rule the world!

                Development for Sonic Adventure had began in April of 1997, with the working title; 'Project Sonic'. The project was originally intended for Sega Saturn, however, many limitations were present when developing the project,
                so 'Project Sonic' was moved to the Dreamcast. This allowed the team to use and exploit the new consules potential! But, the big factor for this project was turning Sonic 2D to 3D.
                A lot of the inspiration for the game's environment and expanded open world was thanks to the team's trip to America! The Ancient Ruins, Lush Jungles, Station Square, etc; All inspired by America.
                When released in late 1998 in Japan, an updated version of Sonic Adventure was made by Sonic Team USA and released worldwide in 1999. A highly anticipated game in Japan did achive some sucees critically and praise.
                In the USA, this was a HUGH success and sold over 1.27 million copies and was the most sold Dreamcast game!
